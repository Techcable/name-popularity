name-popularity
================
An app to test whether your name is 'usual' or 'unusual'
based on social security birth data.

This is for my little brother since he has a crazy obession with names.
He keeps asking these crazy questions about 
the names and I had to write this app so we can accurately answer him.

## Source
Social security birth data: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
 
The data starts in 1880. I have to load each new year into the sqlite databse by using the convert script.
My current server has years 1880-2019 in the database.

I just updated it to include 2018 & 2019 today. Before then, my data stopped at 2017.
